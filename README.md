# address-directory-mongo

I made this to practice Node.JS. 
I used express, MongoDB and postman to build and test this. 
It takes in address and the name of the person and stores it in MongoDB atlas. User can add, view, update and delete 1 or delete all entries from the DB. 
A similar version of this directory exists which uses readLine and filesystem instead of express and MongoDB.
